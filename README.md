## Example usage

```yaml
name: aur-publish

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '*'

jobs:
  aur-publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Publish AUR package
        uses: KSXGitHub/github-actions-deploy-aur@master
        with:
          pkgname: my-awesome-package
          pkgbuild: ./PKGBUILD
          commit_username: ${{ secrets.AUR_USERNAME }}
          commit_email: ${{ secrets.AUR_EMAIL }}
          ssh_private_key: ${{ secrets.AUR_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          commit_message: Update AUR package
          ssh_keyscan_types: rsa,dsa,ecdsa,ed25519
```

**Tip:** To create secrets (such as `secrets.AUR_USERNAME`, `secrets.AUR_EMAIL`, and `secrets.AUR_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` above), go to `$YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL/settings/secrets`. [Read this for more information](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets).

**Tip:** This action does not generate PKGBUILD for you, you must generate it yourself (e.g. by using actions before this action).
